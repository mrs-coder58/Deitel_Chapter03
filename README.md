# Deitel Chapter 03 – Java Exercises

This repository contains my solutions for Chapter 3 of Java How to Program (Deitel).  
I'm working through the book to improve my Java basics step by step.

## 📘 What's inside
- Control statements: `if`, `if-else`, `switch`
- Loops: `while`, `for`, `do-while`
- Counter-controlled and sentinel-controlled repetition
- Nested control statements
- Basic problem-solving exercises
